    <h1>Learning AI</h1>
    <p>I've learned machine learning- and computer vision-related stuff on-the-job, by watching youtube, reading textbooks, and with Andrew Ng's excellent <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?">coursera course</a>. Despite the fact that my job title is "AI &amp; Machine Learning Engineer", I don't consider an image classifier to be AI, even if it is implemented as a convolutional neural net and trained on a GPU. (This doesn't stop marketing people from using the term "AI" pretty liberally). Without minimizing the remarkable breakthroughs that have been made possible by deep learning, I think it's safe to say that recent progress has been primarily in narrow perceptual pattern recognition tasks and reaching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">strong AI</a> will require a lot more progress in knowledge representation, natual language understanding, inferring causality, etc. It seems to me that future progress in "real" AI will come from marrying traditional search and logic-based reasoning with neural network-based perceptual modules.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to round out my AI education, I thought it would be a good idea to learn "good old fashioned AI". Last year, my brother gifted me the classic text in the field, <em>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</em> by Russell and Norvig. I've skimmed it and skipped around, but I thought it would be a good idea to study it seriously for a few months. This page will be a collect links as I blog about my progress working through the book.</p>
